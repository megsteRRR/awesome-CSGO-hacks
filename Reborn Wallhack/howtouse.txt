Regarding Bans:
All our hacks are VAC proof, incase of a VAC, please do inform us so we fix what's not right, also a refund may be provided if you are eligible and have not used any other hacks in last 60 days.
Regarding overwatch, NO refund will be provided, Overwatch bans are reviewed by community members, they are given a demo of 8 random rounds and have to decide if the convicted person is a hacker or not at the end of it, theres no proved way to bypass this.
If you get banned for 'Permanantly untrusted' it is a in-server anticheat, reading how you aim, recoil, shoot, etc. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THE HACK IS DETECTED!

Default Keys:
ESP: F5
Bunnyhop: F6
Exit (Closes cheat): F10

Customization:
All our features are fully customizable check out the CSHreborn.ini file! [ Enemy GLOW-Thickness must be more than 200 for Clear Enemy Glow]






Instructions:
1.) First extract All the Files in a Folder.
2.) Run the game and type "unbind f5" in console to remove screenshot bind so whenever you turn ON hack you dont snap automaticly.
3.) Then Run Reborn.
4.) Press F5 to turn the WALLHACK ON (sometimes its didnt turn on by 1 click so press 2 times if it wont work)
3.) ez game ez lyf.
  

SAFTY Tips:-
1. Use the Hashchanger that is inside the .rar File to to make the hack(reborn.exe) undetected forever.
2. use the hash once in a day so.




Note:

TIP: You want to max avoid getting banned only use ESP/Radar, Aim modifiying will always have a high chance to get you banned, regardless of the cheat being undetected, there is no known way to bypass In-Server anticheat and Overwatch!
